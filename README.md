CSS Style for Adminer
=============

This is a css file for www.adminer.org. It is slightly based on style by Frank Bueltge @link http://bueltge.de/. It exists in two variants: with separate background images and with images saved directly to the css.

To use one-file variant just copy `adminer.css` to directory where is located your `index.php`.

To use css with separate images copy `adminer-separate.css` and all png files to directory where is located your `index.php` and rename css file to `adminer.css`.
